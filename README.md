RubyTalk
========

[Here is the original slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14CCKIB5iXrKT98HmsTGJHgk6ceFDPNabcDzhj25qvmY/edit?usp=sharing)

RubyTalk's goal is to provide an interactive, visual programming environment, much like Smalltalk or Self. Build your applications by interacting directly with objects in memory, rather than their textual representation on the filesystem.

Please note this project is PRE ALPHA. Not ready for even personal use!

# TODO

- support for classes
- support for methods
- support for all objects, not just classes and their methods
- delete objects
- GUI (shoes? morphic? X11? qt? Gtk+? web app?)
- better format for serialization
- serialize on world open/close, rather than object changes (hooks?)
- Rails-like web framework
- multi-user? How would that work?
